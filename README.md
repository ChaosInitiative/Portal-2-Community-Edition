# Portal 2: Community Edition (CHAOSource)

Portal 2: Community Edition is a custom Portal 2 mod base which Critical Error extends.
It makes use of the engine code to extend several features by request of the community and make many quality improvements such as bugfixes, security fixes, and modding tool improvements.

This GitHub repo contains the issue tracker for Portal 2: Community Edition. The current part-time maintainer of P2CE is CitadelCore.
Feel free to open issues for feature/bugfix requests, however communication will be limited to a minimum as developers are bound by a NDA.

Are you a Source licensee and want to contribute to the P2CE codebase? Let me know via the TWP discord or drop me an email at <josephmarsden@towerdevs.xyz>.
